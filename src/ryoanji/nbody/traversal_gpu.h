 * @param[in]    xt,yt,zt,mt,ht target bodies, in SFC order and as referenced by grp, can be identical to sources
 * @param[in]    xs,ys,zs,ms,hs target bodies, in SFC order and as referenced by layout
 * @param[in]    childOffsets   location (index in [0:numTreeNodes]) of first child of each cell, 0 indicates a leaf
 * @param[in]    internalToLeaf for each cell in [0:numTreeNodes], stores the leaf cell (cstone) index in [0:numLeaves]
 *                              if the cell is not a leaf, the value is negative
 * @param[in]    layout         for each leaf cell in [0:numLeaves], stores the index of the first body in the cell
 * @param[in]    sourceCenter   x,y,z center and square MAC radius of each cell in [0:numTreeNodes]
 * @param[in]    Multipoles     cell multipoles, on device
 * @param[in]    G              gravitational constant
 * @param[in]    numShells      number of periodic replicas in each dimension to include
